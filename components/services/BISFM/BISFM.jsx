    <SectionHeadingThree>What is Indian BIS?</SectionHeadingThree>

    <ServiceParagraph>
      The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) is India's national standards body
      under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution.
      Established under the BIS Act 1986, and revised in 2016, BIS plays a
      pivotal role in standardization, marking, and quality certification of
      goods. It aims to ensure the quality, safety, and reliability of products
      offered to Indian consumers.
    </ServiceParagraph>

    <ServiceParagraph>
      A BIS License is mandatory for both Indian and foreign manufacturers to
      manufacture, import or sell various products in India, listed in the BIS
      mandatory certification category. To grant licenses BIS operates various
      certification schemes like Product Certification Scheme (ISI Mark Scheme
      for Indian Manufacturers), Hallmarking Scheme, BIS FMCS Scheme and many
      more.
    </ServiceParagraph>

    <ServiceParagraph>
      Foreign Manufacturers Certification Scheme (BIS FMCS) enables the overseas
      manufacturers to apply for BIS certification to use the standard ISI mark
      on their products. Foreign manufacturers can apply for BIS certification
      by appointing an Authorized Indian Representative (AIR) to handle
      compliance, documentation and communication with the Bureau of Indian
      Standards.

        What is Foreign Manufacturers Certification Scheme (BIS FMCS)
      </SectionHeadingTwo>

      <ServiceParagraph>
        Foreign manufacturers certification scheme (FMCS) was introduced by the
        Bureau of Indian Standards in 2000 that allows the overseas
        manufacturers to use the standard mark (ISI Mark) on their products
        exported to India. Just like the Product Certification Scheme for Indian
        manufacturers, BIS FMCS scheme ensures that the products manufactured
        outside India must meet the same safety and quality standards benchmarks
        before being exported and sold in the Indian market.

        The BIS FMCS logo is issued by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). It
        signifies that products manufactured outside India comply with relevant
        Indian Standards (IS) and are authorized for import and sale. The mark
        includes a unique license number (e.g., CM/L-XXXXXXXXXX) and the IS
        number. The logo must be accompanied by a unique 7 to 10-digit number
        (CM/L-XXXXXXX) that identifies the specific foreign manufacturing unit.
      </ServiceParagraph>

      <ServiceParagraph>
        For a product to bear the Indian BIS or ISI mark, it must pass through a
        rigorous BIS certification process, including lab testing, factory
        inspection, documentation audits, and compliance checks with Indian BIS
        guidelines.
