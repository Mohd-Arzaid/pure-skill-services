      Introduction to BIS Scheme X Certification
    </SectionHeadingTwo>

    <ServiceParagraph>
      The Bureau of Indian Standards, or BIS for short, rolled out &quot;Scheme
      X&quot; on March 16, 2022, aimed at improving compliance on product safety
      and quality in India. Indian and foreign manufacturers can apply for BIS
      certification for Machine and Electrical equipment, components Like
      assemblies, sub-assemblies and, and Tools specified in Schedule-II of
      Scheme-X and take certification prior to exporting, selling, or distributing
      in India.
    </ServiceParagraph>

    <ServiceParagraph>
      Under Scheme X, the manufacturers can apply for a BIS License or a
      Certificate of Conformity (CoC) for low voltage switch gear and control
      gear, machinery, and electric equipment. Once the manufacturers are
      certified, they are allowed to use the BIS Standard mark, indicating that
      their products are in accordance with the standards laid down in India.
    </ServiceParagraph>

    <ServiceParagraph>
      The certification, while promoting the product and compliance with the
      Indian Standards and Government Regulations, helps develop trust and
      confidence of the consumers in the certified products.
    </ServiceParagraph>

    <SectionHeadingThree as="h2">What is Scheme X Certification?</SectionHeadingThree>

    <ServiceParagraph>
      Scheme X is a product certification scheme developed under the BIS
      Conformity Assessment Regulations, 2018 and later on, simplified under the
      BIS Conformity Assessment (Amendment) Regulations, 2022.
    </ServiceParagraph>

    <ServiceParagraph>
      The main goal is to bring the Indian safety and quality standards to global
      standards, especially with regard to the industrial machinery and
      electrical equipment. The products manufactured in or imported to India
      under this scheme are subjected to rigorous scrutiny and assessment to
      prove technical, safety, as well as performance standards.
    </ServiceParagraph>

    <ServiceParagraph>
      Provisions under the original scope of Scheme X Certification have been
      revised for and expanded with the newly issued Machinery and Electrical
      Equipment Safety (Omnibus Technical Regulation) Order, 2024, which is
      under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Heavy Industries and has been
      brought into force by the BIS. The order comes into effect on 1st September
      2026, and covers a broad spectrum of machinery and electrical equipment
      such as pumps for handling liquids, compressors, cranes, rotary electrical
      machines, transformers, and switchgear and control gear.
    </ServiceParagraph>

    <ServiceParagraph>
      Assemblies, sub-assemblies and components of such machinery or equipment
      are also part of the certification scope as per Section 16 of the Bureau of
      Indian Standards Act, 2016.
    </ServiceParagraph>

    <ServiceParagraph>
      Moreover, under the 1989 CMVR Rules (Construction and Manufacture of
      Valve Regulation), Bowser and other types of construction equipment under
      the jurisdiction of Scheme X, are ensured that the market does not get
      exposed to the equipment which lacks the requisite of safety and technical
      standards.
    </ServiceParagraph>

    <SectionHeadingThree as="h2">Omnibus Technical Regulation (OTR)</SectionHeadingThree>

    <ServiceParagraph>
      The Ministry of Heavy Industries released the &quot;Omnibus Technical
      Regulation on Safety Orders (Machinery and Electric equipment
      Safety)&quot; via E-Gazette notification of August 28, 2024. This
      innovative regulation intends to improve - safety, quality and compliance
      of machinery, electrical equipment and their assemblies, sub assemblies
      and components, under Scheme X of the BIS Regulation, 2016.
    </ServiceParagraph>

    <ServiceParagraph>
      Under the OTR, all categories of machinery and electrical equipment, and
      all their parts and components are included. However, a few categories
      are specifically excluded:

    <SectionHeadingThree>Legal Implications</SectionHeadingThree>

    <ServiceParagraph>
      BIS Standard Mark is a mark of trust and quality. The mark is only
      available after a valid contract is in place. Only a valid contract
      allows the owner to use the mark. Using the mark without a valid contract
      is an offense under the Indian constitution and is equal to having a legal
      mark. The owner of the mark is placed under heavy restrictions for the use
      of the license CM/L-XXXXXXXXXX for products that have no BIS
      certification.
    </ServiceParagraph>

    <ServiceParagraph>It follows that every producer is obliged to:</ServiceParagraph>

    <ServiceList

      Validity and Renewal Process of Scheme-X Certificate:
    </SectionHeadingThree>

    <ServiceParagraph>
      <strong>Licence Validity and Renewal:</strong> BIS Licences under Scheme-X
      are issued for a period of 3 to 6 years for continuous production. Once the
      period has expired, the licence can be renewed for the same duration by
      the submission of a renewal application, the required fee, and compliance
      documents.
    </ServiceParagraph>

    <ServiceParagraph>
      <strong>Certificate of Conformity (CoC):</strong> A CoC is issued for One
      time production, and is applicable for domestic as well as overseas
      manufacturers. Since it applies only to a single batch, a CoC has no
      renewal option.
    </ServiceParagraph>

    <ServiceParagraph>
      <strong>Report of Product Tests:</strong> When test reports are prepared in
      the laboratory of the manufacturer, the BIS officials verify them during
      the factory inspection by conducting witness testing. If testing is done at
      subcontracted facilities, those facilities are also inspected and approved
      by BIS.
    </ServiceParagraph>

    <ServiceParagraph>
      <strong>Review of Application for Renewal:</strong> For uninterrupted
      validity, a manufacturer is required to continue to comply with the
      Scheme-X provisions. As per Regulation 8 of the BIS Conformity Assessment
      Regulations, the Bureau of Indian Standards processes the application for
      renewal in form VIII. Renewal is done only after satisfactory compliance is
      verified.

    <ServiceParagraph>
      The BIS Scheme-X Certification remains vital in upholding the safety,
      reliability, and quality of Low-voltage switchgear and control gear,
      Machinery and electrical equipment. For the manufacturers of machine tools
      applicable to processing stone, ceramics, concrete, asphantic cement and
      mineral glass, BIS Scheme-X certification is compulsory.
    </ServiceParagraph>

    <ServiceParagraph>
      By fulfilling these obligations, manufacturers guarantee product
      conformity, enhance consumer confidence, as well as improve their
      credibility on the market. Scheme-X makes sure the production is as smooth
      as possible, safety standards around the world are met, and the recognized
      brands gain a positive reputation.

  },
  {
    question: "Is BIS certification under Scheme X mandatory for exports?",
    answer:
      "No. Products manufactured exclusively for export are exempt under the Omnibus Technical Regulation. However, products meant for Indian markets must be certified under Scheme X.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the validity of the BIS license under Scheme X?",
    answer:
      "A BIS licence under Scheme X is generally valid for 3-6 years and must be renewed accordingly. Renewal involves payment of the annual BIS certification fee and may require re-evaluation depending on changes in product scope or standards.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can foreign manufacturers apply for Scheme X certification?",
    answer:
      "Yes, foreign manufacturers can apply for Scheme X certification through an authorized Indian representative. The Indian BIS requires a factory inspection, which may take 3 days for foreign applicants, along with standard BIS registration and testing processes.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a Technical File and why is it required?",
    answer:
      "A Technical File is a detailed compliance dossier required under Scheme X. It includes manufacturing processes, product details, test reports, and quality control documents. It supports the product's conformity to relevant Indian Standards during the BIS certification process.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is Scheme X related to the Omnibus Technical Regulation?",
    answer:

    answer:
      "Yes. The Indian BIS can suspend or cancel a BIS licence or certificate under Scheme X if non-compliance is found during surveillance or if the product fails to meet required Indian Standards.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What is the difference between BIS license and BIS certificate under Scheme X?",
    answer:
      "A BIS license is typically issued to Indian manufacturers, while a BIS certificate of conformity (CoC) is often issued to foreign manufacturers or for specific cases. Both serve the same purpose—ensuring product compliance under Scheme X.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is the ISI mark allowed for products certified under Scheme X?",
    answer:
      "No. Products under Scheme X do not carry the ISI mark. Instead, they display the BIS standard mark relevant to the certification scheme, as governed by the Indian BIS.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know if my machinery requires Scheme X certification?",
    answer:
      "Check the official list in the Omnibus Technical Regulation or consult with a BIS consultant to verify if your machinery falls under mandatory Scheme X certification requirements.",
