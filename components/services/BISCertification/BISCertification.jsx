      <SectionHeadingThree as="h2">What is BIS Certification?</SectionHeadingThree>

      <ServiceParagraph>
        BIS certification refers to the process of obtaining a quality standard
        certificate from the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) for manufacturing
        and selling various products in India. BIS offers various certification
        schemes through which the manufacturers can secure a BIS license to use
        the standard quality mark on their products. This standard mark
        showcases that their products comply with the required quality, safety
        and reliability standards as set by BIS.
      </ServiceParagraph>

      <ServiceParagraph>
        BIS certification is voluntary in nature but Bureau of Indian Standards
        made it mandatory for various products critical for consumers health and
        safety. BIS issues Quality Control Orders (QCO) to list the products
        that require a mandatory BIS license for manufacturing or importing in
        India.
      </ServiceParagraph>

      <ServiceParagraph>
        For many Indian manufacturers and importers securing BIS certification
        is a must. It covers a wide range of products including electrical
        appliances, cement and steel products, package drinking water,
        electronics like mobile phones, LED lights, power banks, precious metal
        jewelry (through hallmarking) and many more. The manufacturers and
        importers of these mandatory products cannot legally sell or distribute
        goods in India without BIS recognition.
      </ServiceParagraph>

      <SectionHeadingThree as="h2">
        Why BIS Certification Matters
      </SectionHeadingThree>

      <ServiceParagraph>
        Take for instance, a manufacturer from Germany who has invented a unique
        electronic device and is planning to sell it in the fast paced Indian
        Market. The device is unique, and safe and has also gained approvals in
        Europe. However, when the device is brought to the port in India, the
        customs officers hold the device. The question is, &quot;Why?&quot; The
        answer is, the device is supposed to have a BIS certification, which is
        a crucial part to sell electronic products in India.
      </ServiceParagraph>

      <ServiceParagraph>
        Many global and Indian manufacturers deal with the same instances every
        year. For Indian consumers, the BIS mark on a product is not just a
        logo, it is a mark of trust that the product has been tested for quality,
        safety, and reliability. For a business, it is the gateway to one of
        the largest markets in the entire world.

        A Brief History of BIS in India
      </SectionHeadingThree>

      <ServiceParagraph>
        The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) was formed in 1986 taking over the
        Indian Standards Institution (ISI) which was formed in 1947. BIS is now
        considered to be a quality guardian for standards in India and has
        aligned their practices to international levels and made the necessary
        amendments for the Indian conditions.

      <ServiceParagraph>
        The Indian market is enormous, ever-changing, and sensitive to price
        shifts. However, this openness also leaves the market exposed to cheap
        and unsafe goods. In this context, BIS certification acts as a
        protective barrier.

        ISI Mark Scheme (Domestic Manufacturers)
      </SectionHeadingThree>

      <ServiceParagraph>
        For Indian manufacturers, getting a BIS licence is a prerequisite for
        ensuring legal sales of their products within the country. This
        certification is issued by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) to
        certify satisfaction of Indian Standards pertaining to quality, safety
        and performance benchmarks for the products. This includes factory
        audits, product testing and compliance checks with the BIS parameters.
        Once the product is passed, the manufacturers are allowed to put the
        ISI mark on the product. This mark is a trade mark for the manufacturer
        and helps the customer identify a genuine, ISI certified product.
      </ServiceParagraph>

      <ServiceParagraph>
        Regardless of whether it is for electronics, steel, cement, plastic, or
        construction materials, obtaining a BIS certificate is essential for
        gaining market access. Unlike gaining consumer confidence, a BIS
        certificate enhances the reputation of Indian manufacturers, enables
        them to participate in government contracts, and opens up a host of
        other business opportunities. Most importantly, the absence of BIS
        certification can have damaging repercussions, ranging from legal fines
        and product recall to a complete ban of sale in India. Therefore, BIS
        compliance is more than a legal requirement, it is a targeted strategy
        for expanding and maintaining consumer confidence.
      </ServiceParagraph>

      <ServiceParagraph>
        For Indian manufacturers, the ISI mark scheme is the most prestigious
        mark. Under the scheme, Indian manufacturers are required to have their
        products tested at BIS recognized testing facilities. Manufacturing
        sites are subject to inspection and testing. Compliant products are
        granted approval to use the ISI mark. It is an offence to supply
        products like cement, LPG cylinders, electrical cables, packaged
        drinking water and more, without the ISI mark.

        FMCS – Foreign Manufacturers Certification Scheme
      </SectionHeadingThree>

      <ServiceParagraph>
        The Foreign Manufacturers Certification Scheme (FMCS) is a scheme
        developed by the Bureau of Indian Standards for foreign companies
        wishing to enter the Indian Market. This scheme guarantees the safety,
        quality, and performance assurance of the products manufactured abroad
        complying with the required Indian standards. As per FMCS, foreign
        companies wishing to sell products in India must first acquire a Bureau
        of Indian Standards certificate or a license. Like Indian manufacturers,
        foreign manufacturers are also required to secure a BIS license to use
        ISI mark on their product. The desirable ISI mark is given after
        extensive evaluation that includes factory and rigorous product sample
        testing against the Indian Standards.
      </ServiceParagraph>

      <ServiceParagraph>
        A foreign manufacturer is required to appoint an Authorized Indian
        Representative (AIR), who is responsible for communication and
        coordination, as the first point of contact with the Bureau of Indian
        Standards (BIS) for the scheme. It includes the filing of an
        application, in depth compliance evaluation, and the assumption of all
        necessary obligations to achieve compliance within the deadlines. As a
        result of following the FMCS guidelines, foreign companies are able to
        enter the Indian market, as well as acquire goodwill with the customers.
        Any product with an ISI mark shows a high level of quality, safety, and
        reliability assurance in India.
      </ServiceParagraph>

      <ServiceParagraph>
        No foreign products which fall under the regulated categories are

        Scheme X (Omnibus Technical Regulation)
      </SectionHeadingThree>

      <ServiceParagraph>
        Scheme X, or the Omnibus Technical Regulation, is another BIS
        certification Scheme designed by the Bureau of Indian Standards to help
        simplify the compliance procedures of industries in mechanical and
        electrical domains. Unlike the other certification schemes, Scheme X
        focuses on reducing documentation, assessments, and approvals while
        ensuring that products adhere to the Indian Standards. The products
        with the standard mark are of exceptional quality and safety and can be
        sold after undergoing type testing, factory inspections, and simple
        certification of mandatory requirements.
      </ServiceParagraph>

      <ServiceParagraph>
        The scheme X covers heavy machinery and electrical equipment safety
        guidelines for products such as pumps, cranes, transformers, machine
        tools and other heavy engineering products. These are the most
        pertinent industries and all where reliability and safety is a
        necessity. Scheme X is convenient as it shortens the time and costs of
        the complex BIS certification. It aims to streamline the compliance
        process in order to facilitate quicker clearance for marketing and
        enhanced reputation without compromising the quality and safety
        standards. The enduring and traditional reputation of the Bureau of
        Indian Standards enables easier international trade, indispensable for
        companies to meet compliance requirements and boost competitiveness.
      </ServiceParagraph>

      <ServiceParagraph>
        BIS Scheme X is mandatory to access the Indian heavy machine industry.
        This new scheme is important for improved market competition,
        innovation and compliance to regulations which are streamlined through
        this simplified yet robust structure.

      <SectionHeadingThree>Compulsory Registration Scheme (CRS)</SectionHeadingThree>

      <ServiceParagraph>
        The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has developed a BIS certification
        program called the Compulsory Registration Scheme (CRS) aimed at
        regulating IT and electronic products in India. It focuses on assessing
        the safety and quality of high-risk products like LED lights, mobile
        phones, laptops, power banks, and other consumer electronics against
        Indian Standards. CRS, in contrast to the ISI scheme, does not issue an
        ISI mark, but certified products, in compliance with the scheme, bear a
        CRS mark with a unique registration number. All electronics and IT
        products need to be tested in the BIS-recognized laboratories and
        formally registered with BIS CRS, used to ensure compliance before they
        can be sold or imported into India.
      </ServiceParagraph>

      <ServiceParagraph>
        This scheme is essential for protecting Indian consumers from unsafe,
        substandard, or counterfeit electronics, particularly in the case of
        the rapidly growing digital market. Both Indian and foreign manufacturers
        need to acquire CRS certification. The foreign companies must appoint
        an Authorized Indian Representative AIR to ensure compliance. The BIS
        continually updates the list of products covered under the CRS to
        include new products and technologies and emerging safety issues. For
        manufacturers, obtaining BIS registration under CRS is an added
        advantage since it helps in regulatory compliance and it also increases
        customer&apos;s trust, company&apos;s reputation, and market access in
        the electronics industry in India.

      <SectionHeadingThree>Hallmarking Scheme</SectionHeadingThree>

      <ServiceParagraph>
        In India, hallmarking of gold and silver jewellery is compulsory under
        the Hallmarking Scheme and regulated by the Bureau of Indian Standards
        (BIS) which guarantees the purity and genuineness of the jewellery.
        Precious Metal articles are tested at BIS approved Assaying and
        Hallmarking Centres (AHC) and are then stamped with hallmark signs.
        This process is only completed if the articles fulfill the Indian
        Standards laid out at the start. Jewelers must first acquire a BIS
        license which allows them to sell hallmarked jewellery. This is the
        only way to do so legally. The jeweler is obliged to undergo and
        complete product testing, BIS audits, and continuous compliance
        monitoring to sell hallmarked jewellery. The process, in the end,
        protects the consumer and ensures the purity, weight and quality and
        limits malpractice as well as fraud in the jewellery market.
      </ServiceParagraph>

      <ServiceParagraph>
        For Indian consumers, gold and silver are not just ornaments but also
        major investments, which makes trust and transparency essential. The
        hallmarking jewelry is a mark of assurance for the common citizen in
        the country that every piece of jewelry for sale has gone through
        extensive testing against various national benchmarks and fair trading
        practices. Jewelers can showcase their credibility and market reputation
        by hallmarking jewelry. The inability to comply with the rules set
        brings punishment which can include suspension of license. For
        hallmarking under BIS, it serves as a fulfillment of principle-based
        and legal obligations. This not only increases consumer satisfaction but
        also enhances the Indian jewellery market as a whole. This is also the
        case for smaller retailers as well as larger scale manufacturers.
      </ServiceParagraph>

      <SectionHeadingThree>Eco Mark Certification</SectionHeadingThree>

      <ServiceParagraph>
        The Eco Mark is an innovation-centered recognition scheme created by the
        Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) aimed at the promotion of eco-friendly
        goods. Unlike the traditional certification which concerns itself
        prominently with safety and quality parameters, the Eco Mark is awarded
        to goods which conform to Indian Standards and which show at least some
        reduced level of the adverse environmental impact during any one or more
        of the various stages of the life cycle of the goods. Eco Mark
        certification is awarded only after considerable testing and the proving
        of criteria - compliance which includes emission levels, non-toxicity,
        the rate of biodegrade, capacity to recycle and overall interactions
        with the system. Eco Mark, just like the ISI mark, is an emblem of
        assurance from the government which has been granted the status of a
        certification mark, albeit with more pronounced goals of environmental
        sustainability.
      </ServiceParagraph>

      <ServiceParagraph>
        The BIS licence with Eco Mark certifies that a company engages in
        responsible manufacturing and cares about the environment. It ensures
        compliance with the law and creates a competitive advantage with
        protective consumers and sustainability-oriented businesses. Eco Mark
        helps for the industry to trust and adopt green practices and for the
        consumers to trust that the products they buy are safe and
        environmentally responsible. Eco Mark supports India&apos;s vision for
        enhanced quality protection with environmental protection under BIS.

        evaluates and recognizes concerned firms for the implementation of
        internationally accepted and recognized management systems. MSCS
        framework consists of ISO Standards like ISO 9001 Quality Management,
        ISO 14001 Environment Management, ISO 45001 Occupational Health and
        Safety Management System and others. MSCS certifies the firm for the
        legal operations, consistency, and continuous improvement of the
        operations. Certified firms go through numerous assessments and audits
        which helps them build trust among the customers, regulators, and
        stakeholders which strengthens the guarantee of safety, quality, and
        sustainability.
      </ServiceParagraph>

      <ServiceParagraph>
        BIS is the national standards body of India and is the certifying body
        for the enhancement of the organization&apos;s reputation and credibility
        domestically and outside India. MSCS besides fostering accountability
        through periodic supervision and recertification also frees up a
        business to actively support public led programs like Make in India and
        Atmanirbhar Bharat. Besides legal obligation, the scheme also helps in
        cultivating a culture of integrity, efficiency and fair trading. MSCS
        encourages the trade and investment by the certified companies and BIS
        plays a crucial part in the development of the quality ecosystem of the
        country.

      <SectionHeadingThree>LRS – Lab Recognition Scheme</SectionHeadingThree>

      <ServiceParagraph>
        Under the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), the Lab Recognition Scheme
        (LRS) is an integral part of a system that guarantees the dependability
        and overall competency of laboratories that test and certify products
        for BIS approval. Such labs are critically appraised on diverse
        attributes which include technical knowledge, quality of the workforce,
        infrastructure, and the overall competency and satisfaction of the lab
        with the ISO/ IEC 17025 standard. These labs, once approved, are
        permitted to perform testing on the product for which conformity
        assessment is done as part of various BIS certification programs such as
        the ISI Mark Scheme and the Compulsory Registration Scheme (CRS). It is
        clear that for manufacturers, in particular for importers and exporters,
        the reports obtained from an LRS approved lab are a critical requirement
        to achieve a BIS certificate that is a legal requirement for certain
        products.
      </ServiceParagraph>

      <ServiceParagraph>
        The LRS is empowering India&apos;s assurance systems by maintaining equity
        in testing outcomes and ensuring that all outcomes are consistent and
        globally benchmarked, while accrediting only reliable and sound
        laboratories. To uphold integrity and transparency, BIS performs
        regular audits, proficiency tests, and surveillance of recognized
        schematic labs. Recognition of this certification enables BIS to
        improve trust from consumers while making the certification process more
        efficient for industries, as only safe, compliant, and high-quality
        products will be offered in the Indian market. For organizations that
        aim to receive BIS certification, collaboration with LRS-approved labs
        is the most essential to achieve compliance and market access.
